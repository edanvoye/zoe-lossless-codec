  Zoe Grayscale Lossless Codec

Zoe Grayscale Lossless Codec is a video compression/decompression module to be used in AVI files under 
the Video for Windows (VfW) framework. The encoded data will typically be stored inside AVI files. The 
current version allows lossless compression of grayscale video data in the "Y8  " or "Y10 " formats. 
"Y10 " is a new FOURCC code representing 10 bits of grayscale data stored in the LSB of 16 bit words.
